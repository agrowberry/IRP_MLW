# IRP_MLW
Individual Research Project | Machine Learning Winding

This project provides several tools for programmatically designing, evaluating and optimising single-slot electrical windings.

---
 ## Fourier Series Module (Fourier_Generator.py)

Provides a set of tools for constructing basic coil winding geometries. With further tools for parameterising the construction. 

Also provides means for constructing the fourier transformed representation.
